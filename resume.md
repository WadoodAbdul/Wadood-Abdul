### EXPERIENCE

R&D Engineer - **Senseforth.ai** <span style="float: right; ">Jun'20 - Present</span>  

- Audio & Speech: <span style="float: right; ">Apr’ 21 - ongoing</span>
Developing Text-To-Speech systems for different languages and accents.

- SQuAD2.0: <span style="float: right; ">Feb’ 21 - Apr’ 21</span>
 Developed a question-answering module on the SQuAD 2.0 dataset. Achieved the 5th rank in the leaderboard.
 
- NLP Modules: <span style="float: right; ">June’20 - Feb’21</span>
 Developed and deployed modules like
   - Question Generator
   - Semantic Similarity
   - Variation Generator
   - Sentence classifiers

 
Research Student - **IISc** <span style="float: right; ">Aug' 2019 - Mar' 2020</span>  
Quantified microstructure images using 2-point statistics. Modelled the process-structure relationship between the processing parameters and image data.  Studied alternatives for microstructure image encoding techniques. 

Deep Learning Intern - **Vijna Labs** <span style="float: right; ">July 2019 - Dec' 2020</span>  
Studied the effect of convolution kernel and stride size on a binary classification task. This was done on computationally generated data and the Darknet framework was used to build and train the neural networks.

### PROJECTS
**Representative Deformation volume in cantilevers during Power Law Creep**, IISc <span style="float: right; ">Dec' 2018 - May 2019</span>  
Finding the effect of various ratios of creeping and non-creeping material to investigate the minimum volume in sandwich beams that give the same deformation as that of a monolithic beam. 

**Role of powder variability on the Microstructure and Mechanical properties of  DMLS 17-4 PH**, Intech <span style="float: right; ">Time span</span>  
Microstructural and mechanical properties characterization between DMLS samples of different powder origins.
